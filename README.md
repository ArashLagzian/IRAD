# IRAD

**IRAD: Industrial Rubber Anomaly Detection Dataset** (Ongoing)
- Collaborated on creating a dataset of 20,000+ annotated images for rubber surface anomaly detection.
- Implemented state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) for anomaly detection.
- Achieved high detection accuracy metrics: mAP@50 = 98.10%.
